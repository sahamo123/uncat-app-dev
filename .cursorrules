# Agent Rules

## MCP Tool Management
- **Dynamic Permissions**: You have permission to modify `mcp_config.json` to enable or disable MCP tools as needed for your current task.
- **Tool Limit**: Always aim to keep the total enabled tool count below 50 for optimal performance.
- **Action Protocol**: If a required tool is disabled, enable it immediately, perform the action, and then verify if you need to disable other unused tools to maintain the limit.
